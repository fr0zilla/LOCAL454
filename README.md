delicious distro soup

We're making mana for the men,
Taking money from them ends,
We're the means,
We make it mend,
We're the shop,
We don't pretend.

We are the stone that breaks the clan,
We are the the night enshrined in sand,
We are the day, light's guiding hand,
And we take from you all sustenance.
